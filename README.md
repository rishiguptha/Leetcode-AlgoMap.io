## About

**AlgoMap.io** is a free, visually engaging roadmap designed to help developers learn data structures and algorithms from the ground up. It covers topics ranging from basic arrays and strings to advanced dynamic programming and graphs. This repository is my personal collection of solutions and explanations for each of these topics as I work through the roadmap.

---

## Roadmap Overview

The AlgoMap.io roadmap is divided into several key sections:

- **Arrays & Strings** (10 problems)
- **Hashmaps & Sets** (10 problems)
- **2 Pointers** (7 problems)
- **Stacks** (5 problems)
- **Linked Lists** (7 problems)
- **Binary Search** (8 problems)
- **Sliding Window** (6 problems)
- **Trees** (15 problems)
- **Heaps** (5 problems)
- **Recursive Backtracking** (7 problems)
- **Graphs** (10 problems)
- **Dynamic Programming** (10 problems)

*Each section not only improves your conceptual understanding but also equips you with coding practice for real-world interviews.*
